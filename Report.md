## pandas

I used pandas because it's easy to work with data with pandas.
I have less code, it saves time and I have a better oversight.
For other things it was easier to not use pandas, because of what I already learned and could apply.

## colorama

I used colorama to print colored text in the terminal. I used this module because it's easy to learn and easy to use.
I had a lot of trouble installing other modules, but this one worked immediately.
It gives the text a nice colour without a lot of work. There is more oversight if certain text is coloured.
It's better to work with for the user.

## csv file

I used one csv file. First I used two, but I find it easier to work with when there is only one csv file. You have all the data together.
There is more data in the file and maybe the oversight is less. But when you have data of bought and sold and you want to compare,
it's easier when it's in one file and you need less code.
